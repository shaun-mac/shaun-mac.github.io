      <p>my name is shaun and i'm a developer. i was born in the north and live on the canadian west coast, where i
        build websites now. in a past life i was also a copywriter. before that i was a grad student, researcher, and
        musician. i mastered none of these things. and i still dabble. all of these different chapters led me to where
        i am now. programming is the combination of inquiry, creativity, and critical thinking that i value. this site
        will represent my current location in my journey towards mastery at something, finally, maybe. in other words,
        it is work in progress and is going to change a lot.</p>
